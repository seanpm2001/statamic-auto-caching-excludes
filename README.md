# Auto Caching Excludes

This addon listens for page edits and updates caching excludes when there are forms on the page. This plugin assumes you have a main content field (A replicator or a Bard) on your pages. In this main content field you have added the ability to add a form. When this form module is detected the page (and all localized versions) will be added to *static_caching_exclude*.

Download the plugin and add it to your addons folder.

Make sure you configure the plugins settings.

I'm my no means a skilled programmer at the time of writing. Feel free to treat this code as your own.
